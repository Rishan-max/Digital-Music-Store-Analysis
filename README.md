It is a digital music store sales analysis project. I analyze and query the data sets using facts, metrics, and data to guide strategic business decisions that align with your goals, objectives, and initiatives.
For example here I extracted meaningful information such as total invoices, best customers, popular artists, tracks, etc.
Utilized PostgreSQL to extract data from 11 different related tables from music store databases using JOIN and VIEW.
Transformed and filtered data by using aggregating and filtering functions to improve the reporting process.
Write 11 queries to extract meaningful insights from the datasets and use them to make the final report. 
Used window function, joins, cte, subquery formed schema or data model using foreign key for query the database appropiately.
Loaded all information into PowerPoint to represent key business intelligence that can improve sales performance.
